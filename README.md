# Securely share your files

Easy to use SFTP ([SSH File Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol)) server with [OpenSSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH).

# Usage

- Define users in (1) command arguments, (2) `SFTP_USERS` environment variable
  or (3) in file mounted as `/etc/sftp/users.conf` (syntax:
  `user:pass[:e][:uid[:gid[:dir1[,dir2]...]]] ...`, see below for examples)
  - Set UID/GID manually for your users if you want them to make changes to
    your mounted volumes with permissions matching your host filesystem.
  - Directory names at the end will be created under user's home directory with
    write permission, if they aren't already present.
- Mount volumes
  - The users are chrooted to their home directory, so you can mount the
    volumes in separate directories inside the user's home directory
    (/home/user/**mounted-directory**) or just mount the whole **/home** directory.
    Just remember that the users can't create new files directly under their
    own home directory, so make sure there are at least one subdirectory if you
    want them to upload files.
  - For consistent server fingerprint, mount your own host keys (i.e. `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*`)

# Examples

## Simplest docker run example

```
docker run -p 22:22 -d ghcr.io/muratovas/docker-sftp foo:pass:::upload
```

User "foo" with password "pass" can login with sftp and upload files to a folder called "upload". No mounted directories or custom UID/GID. Later you can inspect the files and use `--volumes-from` to mount them somewhere else (or see next example).

## Sharing a directory from your computer

Let's mount a directory and set UID:

```
docker run \
    -v <host-dir>/upload:/home/foo/upload \
    -p 2222:22 -d ghcr.io/muratovas/docker-sftp \
    foo:pass:1001
```

### Using Docker Compose:

```
sftp:
    image: ghcr.io/muratovas/docker-sftp
    volumes:
        - <host-dir>/upload:/home/foo/upload
    ports:
        - "2222:22"
    command: foo:pass:1001
```

### Logging in

The OpenSSH server runs by default on port 22, and in this example, we are forwarding the container's port 22 to the host's port 2222. To log in with the OpenSSH client, run: `sftp -P 2222 foo@<host-ip>`

## Store users in config

```
docker run \
    -v <host-dir>/users.conf:/etc/sftp/users.conf:ro \
    -v mySftpVolume:/home \
    -p 2222:22 -d ghcr.io/muratovas/docker-sftp
```

<host-dir>/users.conf:

```
foo:123:1001:100
bar:abc:1002:100
baz:xyz:1003:100
```

## Encrypted password

Add `:e` behind password to mark it as encrypted. Use single quotes if using terminal.

```
docker run \
    -v <host-dir>/share:/home/foo/share \
    -p 2222:22 -d ghcr.io/muratovas/docker-sftp \
    'foo:$1$0G2g0GSt$ewU0t6GXG15.0hWoOX8X9.:e:1001'
```

Tip: you can use this Python code to generate encrypted passwords:  
`docker run --rm python:alpine python -c "import crypt; print(crypt.crypt('YOUR_PASSWORD'))"`

## Logging in with SSH keys

Mount public keys in the user's `.ssh/keys/` directory. All keys are automatically appended to `.ssh/authorized_keys` (you can't mount this file directly, because OpenSSH requires limited file permissions). In this example, we do not provide any password, so the user `foo` can only login with his SSH key.

```
docker run \
    -v <host-dir>/id_rsa.pub:/home/foo/.ssh/keys/id_rsa.pub:ro \
    -v <host-dir>/id_other.pub:/home/foo/.ssh/keys/id_other.pub:ro \
    -v <host-dir>/share:/home/foo/share \
    -p 2222:22 -d ghcr.io/muratovas/docker-sftp \
    foo::1001
```

## Providing your own SSH host key (recommended)

This container will generate new SSH host keys at first run. To avoid that your users get a MITM warning when you recreate your container (and the host keys changes), you can mount your own host keys.

```
docker run \
    -v <host-dir>/ssh_host_ed25519_key:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key \
    -v <host-dir>/ssh_host_rsa_key:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key \
    -v <host-dir>/share:/home/foo/share \
    -p 2222:22 -d ghcr.io/muratovas/docker-sftp \
    foo::1001
```

Tip: you can generate your keys with these commands:

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ssh_host_ed25519_key < /dev/null
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ssh_host_rsa_key < /dev/null
```

## Execute custom scripts or applications

Put your programs in `/etc/sftp.d/` and it will automatically run when the container starts.
See next section for an example.
